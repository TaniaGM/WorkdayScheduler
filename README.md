# WorkdayScheduler
Creating a one day work scheduler


Creating a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The audience is a busy employee who can add important events to a daily planner so s/he can manage time effectively.

When employee opens the planner, the current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar.

When employee scrolls down, s/he is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.

When employee views the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate
whether it is in the past, present, or future.

When employee clicks into a timeblock, they can enter an event.

When employee clicks the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage.

When employee refreshes the page, the saved events persist.
